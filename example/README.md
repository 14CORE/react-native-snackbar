# Snackbar Example

## Usage

1. `yarn install`
2. `react-native run-android`

## Troubleshooting

In some cases, Yarn may not install the `..` dependency properly.
If you have problems, you should try the following (after the "Usage" steps above):

1. `rm -rf node_modules/react-native-snackbar`
2. `npm install ..`
